# Intense, transformative coding (crucible)

Welcome to the Crucible C Project!

This repository is dedicated to exploring the foundations and depths of system-level programming using the C language. Our goal is to understand how memory is managed under the hood, how the system interacts with code, and to build a strong base for advanced programming concepts.

## Folders

- [brocode
  ](brocode/)Contains the basics of C language, following the [Bro Code C In-Depth Summit](https://youtu.be/xND0t1pr3KY?si=khYHChSzkFGea0BR). Start here to build your foundation in C.
- [confusions](confusions/)
  (Coming soon) A collection of programs and explorations to clarify common confusions in C, such as `size_t`, macros, pre/post increment, and more.

Feel free to explore the folders, run the code, and contribute your own insights or improvements.

**Happy Coding!**

We will continue to learn more in-depth C from additional resources and summits as the project grows.
